          Thanks a lot for your contribution! 
          
          It may take some time before we review a PR, so even if you donâ€™t see activity for some time, it doesnâ€™t mean that we have forgotten about it. 
          
          Every once in a while we go through a process of prioritization, after which we are focussing on the tasks that were planned for the upcoming [milestone](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/milestones). The prioritization status is typically reflected through the PR labels. It could be pending triage, a candidate for a future milestone, or have a target milestone set to it.
